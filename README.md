# Benchmark Sound Law LSTM

Part of a project that tries to automatically derive sound laws from a list of cognates. This model serves as a benchmark to demonstrate the performance of a generic model (an LSTM) on the transfer learning task of predicting cognates in related daughter languages.

This project uses the ielex dataset as provided in JÃ¤ger et al. 2017, "Using support vector machines and state-of-the-art algorithms for phonetic alignment to ientify cognates in multi-lingual wordlists". I have chosen to use Old Norse and its daughter languages (eg Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian) since they have cognates provided in that dataset.
